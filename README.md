## App-Workshops

I've put together this repo as a resource for you to be able to review what we've discussed in the workshops. The documentation here is in no way designed to replace the workshops, and you may struggle to understand the notes alone without attending the workshops.

####Why GitHub?
I've chosen to do it in the format for several reasons:
+ It gets you on github.
+ It makes it easy to correct errors (my time is limited, so I write these fast). 
+ It makes it easy to get syntax highlighting on code snippets.  
+ Easier for you to copy/paste...even though you would never do that ;). 
+ I'm hhoping that you guys can fork, contribute and send me pull requests to the documentation.  
+ You can create issues to ask questions. That way everyone can see them.
